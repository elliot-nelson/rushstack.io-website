## IFileSystemCopyFilesAsyncOptions.alreadyExistsBehavior property

Specifies what to do if a destination path already exists.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
alreadyExistsBehavior?: AlreadyExistsBehavior;
```

## Remarks

This setting is applied individually for each file being copied. For example, `AlreadyExistsBehavior.Overwrite` will not recursively delete a folder whose path corresponds to an individual file that is being copied to that location.
